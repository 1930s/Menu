# Menu

This repo contains much of the code detailed in my posts 

[The iOS menu](https://codea.io/blog/the-ios-menu/) and [Detailing the iOS menu](https://codea.io/blog/detailing-the-ios-menu/)

It's not a library or something that I've packaged as a dependency. I've just pushed an entire test project up so people can refer to the code.
